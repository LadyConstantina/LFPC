Please, download the lab1.py and grammar.txt files

Exercises:

1. Write a function that will transform a regular grammar in Finite Automata. Use a graphic library to plot it

#-> See function Finit_Automata in file lab1.py

2. Using Finite Automaton (FA) check if some input string is accepted by FA  (meaning you could generate that string by traversing FA)

#-> See function acceptable in file lab1.py

3.For the formal grammar G=(VN, VT, P, S) need be obtained five strings, that belong to the
language L(G), that is generated by this grammar. The length of strings must be no lesser than
the number of characters from the alphabet VN+2. 

#-> See function wg in file lab1.py

4. For each string build the noninverted (derivation) tree and derivation table

#-> See function wg in file lab1.py

5. Determine the grammar type by the Chromsky classification

Variant 10. 
VN={S, B, L}, 
VT={a, b, c } ,
P= {
1. S->aB
2. B->bB
3. B->cL
4. L->cL
5. L->aS
6. L->b }

#-> This grammar is of Type 3
